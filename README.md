Hangman Game

Python allows for quick and easy creation of simple games due to its clean syntax and a variety of libraries designed for game development, Right i have written a Hangman game code using pyhton language.
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to figure out a hidden word by guessing letters within a limited number of attempts.The hangman game is a multiplayer game. In this game, one player selects a word. Other players have a certain number of guesses to guess the characters in the word. If the players are able to guess the characters in the entire word within certain attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

How the Game Works:
1. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. The player is shown a series of blank spaces representing the letters of the hidden word.
3. The player guesses one letter at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in its correct position(s) in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one of their limited attempts (e.g., 6 or 7 wrong guesses).
6. The game ends when the player either:
   -Successfully guesses the word, or
   -Runs out of attempts, at which point they "lose" the game.


FEATURES:
-Random word selection.
-Display of correctly guessed letters and remaining attempts.
-Player feedback on each guess (correct or incorrect).
-End game conditions (win or lose) based on the player's guesses.
